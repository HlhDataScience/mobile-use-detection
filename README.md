# Mobile Usage Detection

## About

This repository is a small sample of how we can leverage competent MLOps workflows with simple tools and good results. We use GitHub and dvc to version control both our code and our data. We also use pydantic to ensure good data input serialization (for EDA and training steps) as well as backend with FastAPI. Finally, we have a gradio powered app and a Docker image to use it in cloud computing. To make the code more reusable, we decided to implement interfaces and abstract classes bvy using prtocol and abc from python standar library, making the code more portable and usable.

**The project is divided into 2 directories**:
  - images : This are thedocker ready files. it uses interface starategy to not realy in one speficic framework. Related to ptest performed, FastApi and Streamlit were choosen as they perform quite well.
  - src: MOdular soruce code yused to perform Exploratory Data Analysys (EDA), the transformation pipeline of data and the TrainerPipeline. We rely on abstractions to make the modules reusable with other frameworks.

**How to mainly use it?**
The repository is thought ytto use the docker image, but we also provide the source code inc ase you would like to change anything. We provide 2 main uses for this repo:
- One: Use the training pipeline by the Makefile
- Two: Using Docker compose.

**Using the training pipeline**

```
git clone https://github.com/HlhDataScience/mobile-use-detection
cd mobile-use-detection
make run_all
```

**Using the Docker Compose**
```
cd images
docker-compose up --build
```
## Done related to EDA_train_phase
- We have completed the Hydra config to handle yalm automatization of the pipeline.
- We have created the logger.py file that handles logging across the files.
- We have completed the data validation & serialization classes
- We have performed the EDA analysis
- Created an ABC Pipeline class to be aligned with SOLID principles.
- Created ABC validation classes and its interfaces for data and configuration validation
- Tested LazyTransformationPipeline refactored as a subclass of BasicPipeline(ABC) abstract class.
- Tested the run method of the pipeline with interfaces and good results.
- Tested the rest of the methods of CV with good results.
- Completed train.py class.
- Completed test for TrainerPipeline: Everything works properly.
- Created Makefile for main.py
- Tested main.py. It works without problem.
- Created KNN deviating branch to test different experiments.
- Created the dvc pipeline managing system
- Created class methods for ABC_Pipeline. ABC_Pipeline now is more flexible.

## Done related to production_phase
  - Refactored structure of the project to work with the 2 development and production phases of MLOps
    - Created the FastAPI app
  - Created the agnostic processor of the API framework
  - System of dev fastapi works with agnostic implementation
  - Infrastructure for the web app created.
  - Created class methods and protocols for the api functions
  - Included headers and root information
  - Included pydantic validation through the predict, results and get_results methods
  - Included query functionality for the small json file used as database.
  - All the functions of the API adhere to EndPointProtocol class.
  - Created the interfaces for the app and tested them in jupyter notebook
  - Updated Makefile to support the different apps.
  - Completed refactor after dockerization of the project.
