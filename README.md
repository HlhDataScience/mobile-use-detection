# Mobile Usage Detection

## About

This repository is a small sample of how we can leverage MLOps workflow with simple tools and good results. We use github and dvc to version control both our code and our data. We also use pydantic to ensure good data input serialization (for EDA and training steps) as well as backend with FastAPI. Finally we have a gradio powered app and a Docker image to use it in cloud computing.
