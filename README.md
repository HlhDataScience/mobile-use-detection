# Mobile Usage Detection

## About

This repository is a small sample of how we can leverage MLOps workflow with simple tools and good results. We use GitHub and dvc to version control both our code and our data. We also use pydantic to ensure good data input serialization (for EDA and training steps) as well as backend with FastAPI. Finally, we have a gradio powered app and a Docker image to use it in cloud computing.

**The project is divided into 2 directories**:
  - EDA_train_phase : IN this directory you will find the full transformation and training pipelines. Based on ABC, the code uses interfaces and abstractions be reusable in other projects with different needs.
  - Production_phase: This directory contains the basic implementation of the app using FastAPI and Gradio to dockerization. In this way can be portable into other systems (local, owned server or cloud computing)

## Done related to EDA_train_phase
- We have completed the Hydra config to handle yalm automatization of the pipeline.
- We have created the logger.py file that handles logging across the files.
- We have completed the data validation & serialization classes
- We have performed the EDA analysis
- Created an ABC Pipeline class to be aligned with SOLID principles.
- Created ABC validation classes and its interfaces for data and configuration validation
- Tested LazyTransformationPipeline refactored as a subclass of BasicPipeline(ABC) abstract class.
- Tested the run method of the pipeline with interfaces and good results.
- Tested the rest of the methods of CV with good results.
- Completed train.py class.
- Completed test for TrainerPipeline: Everything works properly.
- Created Makefile for main.py
- Tested main.py. It works without problem.
- Created KNN deviating branch to test different experiments.
- Created the dvc pipeline managing system
- Created class methods for ABC_Pipeline. ABC_Pipeline now is more flexible.

## Done related to production_phase
  - Refactored structure of the project to work with the 2 development and production phases of MLOps
  - Created the FastAPI app
  - Created the agnostic processor of the API framework
  - System of dev fastapi works with agnostic implementation
  - Infrastructure for the web app created.
  - Created class methods and protocols for the api functions
  - Included headers and root information
  - Included pydantic validation through the predict, results and get_results methods
  - Included query functionality for the small json file used as database.
  - All the functions of the API adhere to EndPointProtocol class.
  - Created the interfaces for the app and tested them in jupyter notebook
  - UUpdated MMakefile to support the different apps.
